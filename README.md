# jQuery Press and Hold


Are you as tired as I am of "Are you sure?" dialog boxes to make sure users don't hurt themselves? Then maybe you are in the right place. This plugin makes the user hold a button down (or any container element) for a priod of time before acting. This is my first attempt at writing a jQuery plugin. I am VERY much open to suggestions.

Also, I totally stole this idea from someone else but I can't remember who it was or where I saw it or even when. 

## Usage
1. Include jQuery of course:

	```html
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
	```

2. Include plugin's code:

	```html
	<script src="jquery.pressAndHold.js"></script>
	```

3. Call the plugin:

	```javascript
	$("#element").pressAndHold();
	```

## Options
* **holdTime:**  
  The amount of time the user needs to hold the mouse button.
* **progressIndicatorRemoveDelay:**  
  Sets a delay on removing the progress indicator. Might be a useful hint to help teach the user how to use the control.
* **progressIndicatorColor:**  
  Color of the progress bar.
* **progressIndicatorOpacity:**  
  Opacity of the progress bar.

## Events
* **start.pressAndHold:**  
  The control has started the holding timer.
* **complete.pressAndHold**  
  The control has completed holding for the entirity of the hold time.
* **end.pressAndHold**  
  The control has completed holding regarless of duration.
